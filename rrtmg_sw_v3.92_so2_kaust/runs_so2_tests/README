This directory contains sample input files and corresponding output files for two atmospheric profiles 
(GARAND1 and GARAND5) at two solar zenith angles. Files tagged with Toba include a Toba-like profile. 
Files with no Toba tag do not have SO2. Simple Perl scripts to run the code and store the output are
also included.
